However, we can't claim that a change of 20°C is twice as significant as a change of 10°C because there's no true zero point.\n",
    "             2.User satisfaction is an ordinal data we can rank the product based on user satisfaction, but we can't say that a product with a rating of 4 is twice as effective as one with a rating of 2.So,treating satisfaction ratings as interval data and trying to calculate a \"mean satisfaction\" would not be appropriate, as the differences between ratings are not necessarily uniform.\n",
